# This file provides the default configuration for the run script.
# It can be used as a reference for the configurable options of the run script.
#
# For parsing this yaml file, we use the SafeLoader from pyyaml.
# Hence it is not possible to load any objects or functions directly.
# However, we implement custom tags for creating objects for configuration classes available within finch.
# The properties of a configuration can be specified with either single values or lists (in which case multiple configurations will be created).
# Note that not all properties allow a list of configuration objects.
#
# For run configurations (finch.DaskRunConfig), use the !config:Run tag.
#   You can specify an implementation ("impl" attribute) as a string following the syntax "<module_name>.<impl_name>",
#   where <module_name> is the name of the experiment module (e.g. "brn") and <impl_name> is the name of the function.
#   It is also possible to only use <module_name>, in which case all implementations of the experiment module will be used.
#   You can specify the preparation ("prep" attribute) by its function name from the preparations available in finch.
#   Alternatively, if your run preparation supports arguments, you can use a single-entry dictionary with the function name mapping to the arguments.
#   The arguments can be specified as a list or a dictionary.
#   For example, the following would indicate a run preparation "prep(arg1=1, arg2='foo'":
#   prep:
#     arg1: 1
#     arg2: foo
# For cluster configurations (finch.scheduler.ClusterConfig), use the !config:Cluster tag.
# For version configurations (finch.data.Input.Version), use the !config:Version tag.
#   You can specify the format attribute by its string representation (e.g. "grib").
