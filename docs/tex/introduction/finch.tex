\subsection{Finch}

Finch is a library for running experiments on data processing operator implementations in Python with xarray \cite{hoyer2017xarray} and dask \cite{rocklin2015dask}.
The main goal of Finch is to provide a framework for profiling runtimes of data processing operator implementations.
The focus lies on helping a programmer to achieve good base performance and good scalability of their parallel implementations.

Additionally, Finch provides implementations for a selection of data processing operators.
