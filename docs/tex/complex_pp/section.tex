\section{Complex Parallel Programs}

Naturally, not every problem is embarrassingly parallel.
Here are some techniques for non-embarrassingly parallel computations.

\subsection{Reformulation}

Sometimes it is possible to reformulate the problem such that it becomes embarrassingly parallel.
For example, let's say we have a computation over a grid with three dimensions, which reduces the vertical dimension and otherwise only performs point wise computations in the horizontal dimensions.
For such a computation, we can simply chunk in the horizontal dimensions instead of the vertical dimension.
The result is an embarrassingly parallel computation.
