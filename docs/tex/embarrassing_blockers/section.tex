\section{Scalability Blockers for Embarrassingly Parallel Problems}

We start by looking at embarrassingly parallel problems and how we can properly parallelize them with dask such that they actually scale.
While not every operator might be embarrassingly parallel, the challenges we encounter for these will also apply to more complex problems.

For embarrassingly parallel problems, we can assume that we can perfectly parallelize the parallel part of our computation.
Implementing a scalable embarrassingly parallel operator mostly boils down to avoiding unnecessary serial computations.
This means that we need to be fully aware of all the serial computations happening in our program.
In complex parallelization frameworks, such as dask, it is easy to miss some serial computations happening below the surface.
However, what is going on under the hood might quickly block proper scalability.
In this section I will therefore list some pitfalls which I encountered when parallelizing operators in Finch.
