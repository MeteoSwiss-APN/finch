\subsection{Input Formats}

How input for our computation is provided is crucial for the final runtime of our program.
Finch support three different data formats: Grib \cite{grib2022}, NetCDF \cite{netcdf2022} and Zarr \cite{zarr2022}

Grib is a common format for providing weather data.
For reading Grib data, xarray provides cfgrib \cite{cfgrib2022} as a backend.
Unfortunately, cfgrib is quite slow compared to alternative data formats and also might also increase the serial overhead vastly.
Additionally, Grib stores its data in layers, which means the chunking is pre-defined.
For three-dimensional data, chunking will be in the vertical.
Re-chunking is possible, but very expensive.

NetCDF is a common alternative to Grib and is currently much faster.
Chunking is not restricted.
Parallel IO is available in principle but is not yet supported by xarray.

Zarr is a cloud-native data format which stores all chunks in individual files.
Unfortunately, Zarr is not yet very common for weather data.
