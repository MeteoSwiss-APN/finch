\subsection{Hidden Blockers in Graph Construction}

Some dask and xarray methods impose a serial overhead which might not be expected.
This subsection provides a selection of such hidden blockers, which I encountered.

\subsubsection{Overwriting Zarr Directories}
Writing to a zarr directory is common for storing outputs or intermediate results.
Dask provides the ability to overwrite a preexisting zarr directory.
Do not use this feature!
It seems that the zarr backend cleans the directory as soon as we call the respective dask method, increasing our serial overhead during graph construction.
Instead, just write to an empty directory.
